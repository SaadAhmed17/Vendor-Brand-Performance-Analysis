**Vendor Sales Summary Data Analysis Project**
**Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing vendor sales and purchase performance data to uncover insights into profitability, vendor contribution, and brand performance. The goal is to support better business decision-making by identifying top-performing vendors/brands, low performers, profit margins, and unsold capital.

The analysis was carried out using Python, MySQL, and Power BI, combining data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and reporting into a structured workflow.

**Technologies & Tools Used**

ðŸ”¹ Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) â€“ for data cleaning, transformation, and statistical analysis

ðŸ”¹ MySQL â€“ for data storage, querying, and vendor summary creation

ðŸ”¹ SQLAlchemy / MySQL Connector â€“ for database connections

ðŸ”¹ Power BI â€“ for building interactive dashboards

ðŸ”¹ Logging & Error Handling â€“ for tracking data ingestion and transformations

**Project Workflow**
**1. Data Ingestion & Cleaning**

ðŸ”¹ Connected to MySQL database containing purchases, sales, prices, and vendor invoices.

ðŸ”¹ Created a Vendor Sales Summary table using SQL queries (CTEs for freight, purchases, and sales).

ðŸ”¹ Cleaned the data in Python:

ðŸ”¹ Removed duplicates & nulls

ðŸ”¹ Converted data types

ðŸ”¹ Handled infinite values and missing values

ðŸ”¹ Standardized vendor/brand names (removed trailing spaces)

**2. Feature Engineering**

ðŸ”¹ New columns were created for deeper analysis:

ðŸ”¹ Gross Profit = Total Sales Dollars â€“ Total Purchase Dollars

ðŸ”¹ Profit Margin = (Gross Profit Ã· Total Sales Dollars) Ã— 100

ðŸ”¹ Stock Turnover = Total Sales Quantity Ã· Total Purchase Quantity

ðŸ”¹ Sales to Purchase Ratio = Total Sales Ã· Total Purchase

**3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

ðŸ”¹ Identified top vendors and brands contributing most to sales.

ðŸ”¹ Detected low-performing vendors and brands with weak margins or low sales.

ðŸ”¹ Analyzed inventory efficiency through unsold capital and stock turnover.

ðŸ”¹ Applied confidence intervals & hypothesis testing to compare top vs. low-performing vendors.

**4. Visualization (Power BI Dashboard)**

ðŸ”¹ Created an interactive dashboard to visualize:

ðŸ”¹ Total Sales, Purchases, Gross Profit, Profit Margin, and Unsold Capital (KPI Cards)

ðŸ”¹ Vendor contribution share (Donut Chart)

ðŸ”¹ Top Vendors by Sales (Bar Chart)

ðŸ”¹ Top Brands by Sales (Bar Chart)

ðŸ”¹ Low Performing Vendors (Bar Chart)

ðŸ”¹ Low Performing Brands (Scatter Plot with Profit Margin vs. Sales)

**Key Insights from Analysis**

ðŸ”¹ Total Sales: $21.92M

ðŸ”¹ Total Purchase: $15.52M

ðŸ”¹ Gross Profit: $6.39M

ðŸ”¹ Profit Margin: 47.46%

ðŸ”¹ Unsold Capital: $1.29M tied up in inventory

ðŸ”¹ Sales are heavily concentrated among a few vendors and brands, creating both risk and opportunity.
ðŸ”¹ Several vendors and brands show low profit margins despite significant sales.
ðŸ”¹ Unsold inventory is a concern, representing ~8% of purchases.

**Conclusion**
This project demonstrates how to integrate Python, SQL, and Power BI for end-to-end data analysis and visualization. It provides a practical framework for analyzing vendor performance, optimizing profitability, and improving supply chain decisions.
